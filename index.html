            Komodo National Park is located in the center of the Indonesian archipelago, between the islands 
            of Sumbawa and Flores. Established in 1980, initially the main purpose of the Park was to conserve 
            the unique Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) and its habitat.

          <h4>Location</h4>
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
              Komodo National Park lies in the Wallacea Region of Indonesia, 
              identified by WWF and Conservation International as a global conservation priority area.  
              The Park is located between the islands of Sumbawa and Flores at the border of the Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) 
              and Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTP) provinces. It includes three major islands, Komodo, Rinca and Padar,
              and numerous smaller islands together totaling 603 km2 of land.  The total size of Komodo National 
              Park is presently 1,817 km2.  Proposed extensions of 25 km2 of land (Banta Island) and 479 km2 of marine
              waters would bring the total surface area up to 2,321 km2.

          <h4>History</h4>
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
            Komodo National Park was established in 1980 and was declared a World Heritage Site and a Man and Biosphere 
            Reserve by UNESCO in 1986.  The park was initially established to conserve the  unique Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), 
            first discovered by the scientific world in 1911 by  J.K.H. Van Steyn.  Since then conservation goals have expanded 
            to protecting its entire biodiversity, both marine and terrestrial.

            The majority of the people in and around the Park are fishermen originally from Bima (Sumbawa), Manggarai, South Flores,
            and South Sulawesi.  Those from South Sulawesi are from the Suku Bajau or Bugis ethnic groups.  The Suku Bajau were originally 
            nomadic and moved from location to location in the region of Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara and Maluku, to make their livelihoods. 
            Descendents of the original people of Komodo, the Ata Modo, still live in Komodo, but there are no pure blood people left and 
            their culture and language is slowly being integrated with the recent migrants.

            Little is known of the early history of the Komodo islanders. They were subjects of  the Sultanate of Bima, although the island’s
            remoteness from Bima meant its affairs were probably little troubled by the Sultanate other than by occasional demand for tribute

        <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-light">
          <h4>Demographics</h4>
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
            There are presently almost 4,000 inhabitants living within the park spread out over four settlements (Komodo, Rinca , Kerora , and Papagaran).
            All villages existed prior to 1980 before the area was declared a national park.  In 1928 there were only 30 people living in Komodo Village , 
            and approximately 250 people on Rinca Island in 1930. The population increased rapidly, and by 1999, there were 281 families numbering 1,169 
            people on Komodo, meaning that the local population had increased exponentially.  Komodo Village  has had the highest population increase of 
            the villages within the Park, mostly due to migration by people from Sape , Manggarai , Madura, and South Sulawesi. The number of buildings
            in Kampung Komodo has increased rapidly from 30 houses in 1958, to 194 houses in 1994, and 270 houses in 2000. Papagaran village is similar in
            size, with 258 families totaling 1,078 people. As of 1999, Rinca’s population was 835, and Kerora's population was 185 people. The total 
            population currently living in the Park is 3,267 people, while 16,816 people live in the area immediately surrounding the Park.

          <h4>Education</h4>
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
           The average level of education in the villages of Komodo National Park is grade four of elementary school. There is an elementary school located 
           in each of the villages, but new students are not recruited each year. On average, each village has four classes and four teachers. Most of the 
           children from the small islands in the Kecamatan Komodo (Komodo, Rinca , Kerora , Papagaran , Mesa) do not finish elementary school. Less than 
           10% of those which do graduate from elementary school will continue to high school since the major economic opportunity (fishing) does not require
           further education.  Children must be sent to Labuan Bajo to attend high school, but this is rarely done in fishermen’s families.

          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
          Most of the villages located in and around the Park have few fresh water facilities available, if any, particularly during the dry season.
          Water quality declines during this time period and many people become ill. Malaria and diarrhea are rampant in the area. On Mesa island, 
          with a population of around 1,500 people, there is no fresh water available. Fresh water is brought by boat in jerrycans from Labuan Bajo.
          Each family needs an average of Rp 100,000.- per month to buy fresh water (2000). Almost every village has a local medical facility with staff,
          and at least a paramedic. The quality of medical care facilities is low.

          <h4>SOCIO-CULTURAL AND ANTHROPOLOGIC CONDITIONS</h4>
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
          Traditional Customs : Traditional communities in Komodo, Flores and Sumbawa have been subjected to outside influences and the influence of traditional
          customs is dwindling. Television, radio, and increased mobility have all played a part in accelerating the rate of change. There has been a steady 
          influx of migrants into the area. At the moment nearly all villages consist of more than one ethnic group.

          Religion : The majority of fishermen living in the villages in the vicinity of the Park are Muslims.  Hajis have a strong influence in the dynamics 
          of community development.  Fishermen hailing from South Sulawesi (Bajau, Bugis) and Bima are mostly Moslems.  The community from Manggarai are mostly Christians.
              
          Anthropology and Language : There are several cultural sites within the Park, particularly on Komodo Island. These sites are not well documented, however,
          and there are many questions concerning the history of human inhabitance on the island. Outside the Park, in Warloka village on Flores, there is a Chinese 
          trading post remnant of some interest. Archeological finds from this site have been looted in the recent past. Most communities in and around the Park can speak Bahasa Indonesia.
          Bajo language is the language used for daily communication in most communities.

          <h4>TERRESTRIAL PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT</h4>
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
          Topography: The topography is varied, with slopes from 0 – 80%.  There is little flat ground, and that is generally located near the beach.  The altitude varies from sea level to 
          735 m above sea level. The highest peak is Gunung Satalibo on Komodo Island.

          Geology: The islands in Komodo National Park are volcanic in origin. The area is at the juncture of two continental plates: Sahul and Sunda. The friction of these two plates has 
          led to large volcanic eruptions and caused the up-thrusting of coral reefs.  Although there are no active volcanoes in the park, tremors from Gili Banta (last eruption 1957)
          and Gunung Sangeang Api (last eruption 1996) are common. West Komodo probably formed during the Jurasic era approximately 130 million years ago. East Komodo, Rinca, and Padar
          probably formed approximately 49 million years ago during the Eocene era.
              
          Climate:  Komodo National Park has little or no rainfall for approximately 8 months of the year, and is strongly impacted by monsoonal rains. High humidity levels year round are 
          only found in the quasi-cloud forests on mountain tops and ridges. Temperatures generally range from 170C to 340C, with an average humidity level of 36%. From November through 
          March the wind is from the west and causes large waves that hit the entire length of Komodo island’s west beach.  From April through October the wind is dry and large waves hit 
          the south beaches of Rinca and Komodo islands.

          <h4>TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS</h4>
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
          The terrestrial ecosystems are strongly affected by the climate: a lengthy dry season with high temperatures and low rainfall, and seasonal monsoon rains. The Park is situated 
          in a transition zone between Australian and Asian flora and fauna.  Terrestrial ecosystems include open grass-woodland savanna, tropical deciduous (monsoon) forest, and quasi cloud forest.

          Due to the dry climate, terrestrial plant species richness is relatively low. The majority of terrestrial species are xerophytic and have specific adaptations to help them obtain and retain water. 
          Past fires have selected for species that are fire-adapted, such as some grass species and shrubs.Terrestrial plants found in Komodo National Park include grasses, shrubs, orchids, and trees.  
          Important food tree species for the local fauna include Jatropha curkas, Zizyphus sp., Opuntia sp., Tamarindus indicus, Borassus flabellifer, Sterculia foetida, Ficus sp., Cicus sp., ‘Kedongdong hutan’ 
          (Saruga floribunda), and ‘Kesambi’ (Schleichera oleosa).

          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
          The terrestrial fauna is of rather poor diversity in comparison to the marine fauna. The number of terrestrial animal species found in the Park is not high, but the area is important from a conservation 
          perspective as some species are endemic.. 
          Reptiles: The most famous of Komodo National Park's reptiles is the Komodo Dragon (Varanus komodoensis).  
          Other than the Komodo Dragon twelve terrestrial snake species are found on the island. including the cobra (Naja naja sputatrix), Russel’s pit viper (Vipera russeli), and the green tree vipers (Trimeresurus albolabris).    
          Mammals:  Mammals include the Timor deer (Cervus timorensis), the main prey of the Komodo dragon, horses (Equus sp.), water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), wild boar (Sus scrofa vittatus), long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis),
          palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus lehmanni), the endemic Rinca rat (Rattus rintjanus), and fruit bats.  One can also find goats, dogs and domestic cats.  
              
          Birds:  One of the main bird species is the orange-footed scrub fowl (Megapodius reinwardti), a ground dwelling bird.  .

          <div class="container-fluid">
            <span class="navbar-text">
          The marine area constitutes 67% of  the Park. The open waters in the Park are between 100 and 200 m deep. The straits between Rinca and Flores and between Padar and Rinca, are relatively shallow (30 to 70 m deep), with strong tidal currents. 
          The combination of strong currents, coral reefs and islets make navigation around the islands in Komodo National Park difficult and dangerous. Sheltered deep anchorage is available at the bay of Loh Liang on Komodo’s east coast, the South 
          East coast of Padar, and the bays of Loh Kima and Loh Dasami on Rinca.

          Indonesia is the only equatorial region in the world where there is an exchange of marine flora and fauna between the Indian and Pacific oceans.

          The three major coastal marine plants are algae, seagrasses and mangrove trees.  Algae are  primitive plants, which do not have true roots, 
          leaves or stems.  An important reef-building algae is the red coralline algae, which actually secretes a hard limestone skeleton that can encrust and cement dead coral together.

            <p>The goals for Komodo National Park are to protect its biodiversity (particularly the Komodo dragon) and the breeding stocks of commercial fishes for replenishment of surrounding fishing grounds.  
            The main challenge is to reduce both threats to the terrestrial and coastal marine resources and while avoiding conflicts between stakeholders.

            A comprehensive 25 year management plan completed in 2000 provides the basis for adaptive management to regulate all uses in the park and address threats while maximizing benefits for local 
            communities in a sustainable way.  To learn more about what steps are being taken to conserve Komodo National Park click on one of the following topics.</p>
